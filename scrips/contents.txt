    messages you want to send, from one UI. For instance, if we want to send an email
    we must open the mail app and for messaging, one of the other available messaging apps on our phone directly.
    Here the user can provide their message, as well as, the email address or phone number of the receiver and by 
    the press of a button, the appropriate application opens with its fields already filled in. 
    This application makes it easier for sending messages from one UI. The application detects the systems language and 
    the corresponding keyboard layout is presented.</p>
    <p>As for its structure, the user is provided with a simple UI that probes them for an email address or a phone number. 
    This field is checked for the validity of its content. For instance, whether the email address conforms with the standard
    published by the appropriate authorities/organizations. This can prevent simple mistakes like the correct form of the email address 
    or the number of digits required in a phone number, saving time for the user. A toast message informs the user in case of a mistake.
    In the case of emails, if an email address is detected, there appears a new field for providing the email subject.
    A simple text field is there for the body of the message. Finally, at the end of the UI, there are three buttons, 
    one for opening the user's messaging app, one for the email application and the third and last one, for clearing the text field.</p>
    <p>The buttons start activities with intents that call the user to open the 
    appropriate applications for each messaging app. A message's contents are sent to the 
    appropriate messaging app through the intent.</p>

    body: "<p>Application for scientific calculations of the functorial, the Fibonacci sequence up to a number and 
    the most common divisor of a stream of numbers. The purpose of this application at the educational level was to learn 
    to work with threads. These calculations are ideal for this purpose since they are computationally expensive for large numbers
    and can crash or freeze the UI if not handled in the background.</p>
    <p>The UI includes an EditText view in which the user provides the numbers separated with commas. A check is run for the 
    proper format of the stream of numbers. If it is not a stream of numbers separated by a comma, a toast message is presented
    to warn the user. There are three buttons, one for each mathematical operation. The calculation results are 
    shown as blocks in a text area field. </p>

    body: "<p>An application that allows the user to create, modify and store calendar events. 
    The events are displayed on a list based on their due date. 
    Due to its simplicity, one can organize events more efficiently. </p>
    <p>Features.The main activity of the application hosts all the calendar events that are not past due, ordered by the date that the event happens,
    from the closest to the latest one. For each event on the list, its title, the date of creation and the due date will be included as well as 
    a check box for bulk deleting events. Events that are past due are still stored in the database, however, they are not displayed on the main
    screen. A button with the '+' sign can be used to add a new event. Once pressed a new activity is started with a new screen that contains 
    the form with the event's information, which the user needs to fill out. The information includes its title, a description and the date of the event.  
    On this new screen, there are three buttons available. One to save the event, another to delete it and a final one to cancel the changes, after each
    operation the user is directed back to the main screen. The event list must be updated after returning from the form screen. The user can also click on
    an event from the event list and be brought to the activity with the form to modify the event's information. All events will be stored in 
    a relational database stored locally.</p>
    <p> The expected learning results are to work with multiple activities and work with databases. No remote connection was required,
    the database was created locally.</p>

    <p>The user can take photographs or video from both the front and back lenses. After the media is taken they are then stored 
    locally (using content providers). Additionally, there are stored, the date and time of creation and location information (as retrieved from the GeoCoder).
    The user can also include a short description (up to 300 characters) of the picture.  The photos will be displayed in a grid-like layout on the main screen,
     using bitmaps as thumbnails. Once clicking on an image thumbnail the user is guided to a new screen where; the image is displayed at its original size and
     the image's details follow after. The description can be modified and stored anew. Finally, the user can delete a selected image.</p>

    the user can add places of interest on the map in the form of pins. Each pin is accompanied by an infowindow, which contains information about the location. 
    The information of each pin where created; is stored locally and displayed on the infowindow of each pin.</p>",
